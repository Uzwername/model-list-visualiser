A sample model list visualiser built for [Model Management Frontend Challenge](https://bitbucket.org/cityscout/front-end-challenge/src/master/).

+ React
+ React DOM
+ Webpack
+ Sass
+ and other great npm & not only npm tools & packages

# How do I launch this?

1. Get the code.

You might just download it from GUI of GitHub or `git clone` it via terminal.

2. Install at least [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) and [cross-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env) or all dependencies with `npm install`.

If you install just json-server & cross-env, the build should still work since it was already boundled. The dev environment in this case, obviously, will not since it needs dependencies to be installed.

3. Open up terminal, write `npm run server`, hit enter.

Ensure no error occured and server launched correctly.

4. Go to folder called "dist", find file called "index.html" there and throw it into your browser.

5. Unless your browser is quite old, or something really strange happened, you should see a working web aplication with pagination, sorting & search being the main features.
